# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
There are a few ways you can contribute and a few things to consider.

If you are unsure about something, come [chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/8Fjy6PTfXu) or [create a discussion](https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se/discussions).

### Translations

Do you speak multiple languages?
Making SD Maid accessible to more people is absolutely awesome!

Consider joining SD Maid SE's translation project on Crowdin:
https://crowdin.com/project/sdmaid-se

If your target language is not yet available, create an issue ticket about adding support.

### Clutter definitions

Found something that SD Maid does not yet detect?
Parts of SD Maid rely on manually added definitions for clutter and filters for expendable files.

You can either open an issue ticket and wait for someone to add it or directly create a pull request.

Example issue ticket:

https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22c%3A+ClutterDB%22+is%3Aclosed

Example entry in the database:

https://github.com/d4rken-org/sdmaid-se/blob/c99805a73d4338c3a8adb809d1d6820d3c27c2b0/app/src/main/assets/clutter/db_clutter_markers.json#L12545-L12548

### Code

You can code? üôèüèª
You could help fix some bugs, polish existing features or even add new ones!
But even if your fingers are itching, don't just start coding and open a PR.

First create an issue ticket about what you want to do or comment on an existing issue ticket that you want to tackle.
Once your assigned, you can go all out :).

This prevents you wasting time on stuff that is already being worked on and prevents feature creep.
There are many great ideas but not all fit within SD Maid's scope.
